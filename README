outcurses by Nick Black <dankamongmen@gmail.com>
------------------------------------------------

Outcurses is an extension to NCURSES by Thomas Dickey et al, in the spirit of
the Panels, Menu, and Forms extensions. It does not require patching the
NCURSES source. You might need to rebuild it to take advantage of all features,
but this is unlikely if you're using your distro's NCURSES package. Make sure
that the "wide" version (NCURSESW) is available.

* Building

NCURSES 6.1 or newer with wide character support is required.
CMake 3.15 or newer is required. Chant the standard incantations.

---------------
Panel wheels implement a dynamic collection of collapsible panels within a
provided Ncurses WINDOW *. The panels can be independently grown and shrunk,
any number of panels can be created, and panels and disappear and reappear. At
any time, zero or one panels have the focus (zero only if there exist no
panels). Visible space is allocated to the focused panel up through its needs,
if possible. If any space remains, it is allocated to other panels based in
order of their distance from the focused panel, until exhausted.

Arbitrary absolute selection of a panel is supported, as are "next" and
"previous" relative selections (i.e., search, up/left, and down/right). The
panels can be thought of as pasted to the outside of a cylinder (the "wheel")
for the purposes of selecting the "next" or "previous" panel. Note that this
means, if the visual space is not exhausted, that selecting "next" or
"previous" at the lower or upper boundary respectively will permute the
displayed panels. This is so that the user interface is consistent across all
possible panel dynamics.
